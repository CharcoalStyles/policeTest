While purchasing goods and services are everyday tasks in the public sector, these activities can be vulnerable to exploitation for private benefit by NSW public officials, suppliers and cybercriminals. This video by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), NSW, Australia, provides examples of red flags commonly associated with corrupt procurement activities within public authorities. A single red flag can indicate serious corruption, but it could also highlight poor practice that is not corrupt, something that legitimately arises from an unusual circumstance, or an honest mistake. If you see a red flag, it is important that you raise it with your manager. If it cannot be clearly explained, then you are encouraged to report it internally and/or to make a report to the ICAC. ",

A gift can be anything of value; tickets, accommodation, food, or discounts on goods and services. While some gifts and hospitality are token in nature and do not entail much risk – for example, a modest thank you gift presented to a speaker at a conference – others may be intended to secure favourable treatment or cultivate a relationship with a government employee. These “gifts-of-influence” are often the subject of complaints made to the ICAC.",

A conflict of interest exists when a reasonable person perceives that a public official’s personal interests are favoured over their public duties. Unfortunately, conflicts of interest for public officials are an unavoidable aspect of public service and are often insufficiently understood and mismanaged. If you see or suspect a conflict of interest involving any NSW public officials, it is important to speak up about it. The ICAC has a range of resources available to better understand this basic standard of corruption prevention.
